# AI-Powered Code Generation

AI code generation tools can significantly speed up development by suggesting code completions, generating entire functions, or even creating boilerplate code. This guide will help you get the most out of these tools.

## Getting Started with AI Code Generation

### Basic Techniques

1. **Function Implementation**
   - Describe what you want the function to do in natural language
   - Let the AI generate the implementation
   - Review and test the generated code

2. **Code Completion**
   - Start typing your code
   - Accept relevant suggestions
   - Use tab to cycle through options

3. **Code Translation**
   - Convert code between programming languages
   - Update legacy code to modern standards
   - Migrate between frameworks

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Prompts

- Be specific about your requirements
- Include the programming language and framework
- Specify any constraints or edge cases
- Provide context when necessary

If you ask AI to build you an app, it will do it. If you wanted a secure app using a certain framework that follows specific coding standards and accessible design, you would need to specify that in the prompt. 

### Example Prompt

```
Build me an Astro site using the Starlight template. The site title is "AI Enhanced Dev" and it shows guides and tips for developers to use AI in their work.
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Boilerplate Code
Generate common code structures like:
- API endpoints
- Database models
- Configuration files
- Test cases

### 2. Algorithm Implementation
- Sorting and searching algorithms
- Data processing pipelines
- Mathematical computations

### 3. Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks
- Input validation
- Logging statements

## Limitations and Considerations

- **Code Quality**: Always review generated code
- **Security**: Be cautious with sensitive information
- **Performance**: Test for efficiency
- **Licensing**: Be aware of open-source licenses

## Advanced Techniques

### Context Management
- Keep relevant files open for better context
- Add relevant files and folders to the prompt
- Use comments to guide the AI
- Provide examples of your coding style (create `Select` component in the style of `Input`)
