# AI Tools for Developers

The AI landscape is rapidly evolving, with new tools developing to help developers in different parts of their work. This guide provides an overview of the tools I find most useful today. You can expect it to change regularly.

## Code Generation

- **[Amazon CodeWhisperer](https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/)**: Real-time code recommendations
- **[Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)**: AI-first code editor with built-in pair programming
- **[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)**: AI pair programmer that suggests code as you type
- **[Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com/)**: AI code completion that works with multiple IDEs
- **[Windsurf](https://windsurf.dev/)**: AI-powered development environment with advanced code generation

## Code Review & Quality

- **[Codiga](https://www.codiga.io/)**: Static code analysis with AI
- **[DeepCode/SonarQube](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarqube/)**: AI-powered code review
- **[Sourcery](https://sourcery.ai/)**: Automated code refactoring

## Documentation

- **[Documatic](https://www.documatic.com/)**: Automated code documentation
- **[Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/)**: AI-powered documentation generator
- **[Scribe](https://scribehow.com/)**: AI that writes documentation as you work

## Testing

- **[Applitools](https://applitools.com/)**: Visual AI for test automation
- **[Mabl](https://www.mabl.com/)**: Intelligent test automation
- **[Testim.io](https://www.testim.io/)**: AI-powered test automation

## Getting Started with AI Tools

1. **Start with one tool** - Don't try to learn everything at once
2. **Integrate into your workflow** - Add tools to your existing development environment
3. **Learn the shortcuts** - Most tools have keyboard shortcuts to speed up your workflow
4. **Be critical** - Always review AI-generated code and suggestions

I suggest starting with [Windsurf](https://windsurf.dev/) as it brings a full VS Code experience (including support for VS Code extensions) with out-of-the-box support for AI coding assistants. Everything is built-in. One download and you're ready to start creating with AI. While you can pay for more advanced models and higher usage, the free tier gets you a sufficient amount of monthly usage to get started.

## Choosing the Right Tool

Consider these factors when selecting an AI tool:

- **Integration** with your existing tools
- **Pricing** and licensing
- **Privacy** and data handling policies
- **Community** and support
- **Customization** options
